= Installing Integreatly

:toc:
toc::[]

= Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of Ansible playbooks that can be used to install a range of Red Hat middleware products on Openshift.

These products include:

* Single Sign On
* Managed Services Broker
* EnMasse
* Eclipse Che
* Launcher
* 3Scale

== Prerequisites

.Prerequisites
|===
|Requirement |Version
|Ansible
|>= v2.6
|Openshift Container Platform
|>= v3.10
|Openshift CLI (OC)
|>= v3.10
|===


[WARNING]
====
* SSH Access to Openshift master(s)
* Cluster administrator permissions
* The ssh user defined in the inventory, `ansible_user`, needs have sudo permission
====

== Installation Steps

The following section demonstrates how to install each of the products listed above on an existing Openshift cluster.

:numbered:
== Clone installation GIT repository locally

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/installation.git
----

== Create the inventory hosts file

. Create the host file based on the template(`../inventories/hosts.default`). Following the an example.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cp inventories/hosts.template inventories/hosts
----
. Update the host file to connect in your OpenShift cluster
+
Prior to running the playbooks the master hostname and associated SSH username *must* be set in the inventory host file to match the target cluster configuration. The following example sets the SSH username to *evals* and the master hostname to *master.evals.example.com*:
+
[source]
----
~/installation/inventories/hosts

[local:vars]
ansible_connection=local

[local]
127.0.0.1

[OSEv3:children]
master

[OSEv3:vars]
ansible_user=evals

[master]
master.evals.example.com
----
+
NOTE: It is possible to add the variable `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` for the master host when the ssh connection requires a public key.(E.g`ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ocp-workshop.pem`)

== Check the connection with the OpenShift cluster

Run the following command in order to check the connection with the OpenShift cluster from the root of the repository.

[source,shell]
----
$ ansible -m ping all
----

Following an example of the expected output.

[source,shell]
----
$ ansible -m ping all
127.0.0.1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
master.example.openshiftworkshop.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

== Log into OpenShift

Before run the scripts it is required login via oc client tool to the master/OCP. Following an example.

[source,shell]
----
oc login master.example.openshiftworkshop.com -u <user> -p <password>
----

You can install Integreatly using either of the following options:

. link:#install-all[Install all products from a single playbook]
. link:#install-individually[Install each product individually]

[[install-all]]
== Install all products from a single playbook

All products can be installed using the *install.yml* playbook located in the *playbooks/* directory.

Before running the installer, please consider the following variables:

.Install playbook variables
|===
| Variable | Description
| eval_self_signed_certs | Whether the OpenShift cluster uses self-signed certs or not. Defaults to `true`
| eval_threescale_enable_wildcard_route | Whether 3Scale enables wildcard routing. Defaults to `false`
| github_client_id | GitHub OAuth client ID to enable GitHub authorization for Launcher. If not defined, GitHub authorization for Launcher will be disabled
| github_client_secret | GitHub OAuth client secret to enable GitHub authorization for Launcher. If not defined, GitHub authorization for Launcher will be disabled
| prerequisites_install | Boolean var that skips the installation of system wide tools/packages that are required by the installer if set to false (needs to be set to false when running the installer in a linux container) - defaults to true. 
|===


=== Create GitHub OAuth to enable GitHub authorization for Launcher

. Login into GitHub
. Go to `Settings >> Developer Settings >> New OAuth App`. Following an image as example to ilustrate this area.
+
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7708031/48856646-dea13780-edae-11e8-9999-16b61dcc05ca.png[GitHub OAuth App]

. Add the following fields values
+
.Fields values descriptions
|===
|Field |Value
|Application Name
|Any value
|Home Page URL
|http://localhost
|Authorization callback URL
|http://localhost
|===
+
IMPORTANT: The callback URL is a placeholder for now and will be changed after the installation playbook is finished.

. Click on `Register Application`
. The values found in GitHub OAuth App, `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, will be required in the next step to install Integreatly enabling GitHub authorization for Launcher. Following an example of this screen.
+
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7708031/48856868-7141d680-edaf-11e8-836f-4d533f8ed402.png[GitHub OAuth App Fields]

=== Run the playbook

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url> -u <user> -p <password>
$ $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/install.yml -e github_client_id=<your_client-id> -e github_client_secret=<your_client_secret>
----

[TIP]
====
The following command installs Integreatly without GitHub authorization for Launcher.

[source,shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/install.yml
----
====

=== Add the generated Authorization callback URL to GitHub OAuth

Following and example of the output made at the end of the playbook with this URL.

[source,shell]
----
TASK [debug] *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [127.0.0.1] => {
    "msg": "All services have been provisioned successfully. Please add 'https://launcher-sso-launcher.apps.example.openshiftworkshop.com/auth/realms/launcher_realm/broker/github/endpoint' as the Authorization callback URL of your GitHub OAuth Application."
}
----

The `http://localhost` placeholder added in the GitHub OAuth App should be replaced with this value. Following an example.

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7708031/48856981-c1209d80-edaf-11e8-9d23-f550c7ec31be.png[GitHub OAuth auhotization callback URL, 640]

[[install-individually]]
== Install each product individually

Each product has an associated install playbook available from the *playbooks/* directory.

=== Run Single Sign On install playbook

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/rhsso.yml
----

Upon completion, a new identity provider named *rh_sso* should be presented on the Openshift master console login screen.

WARNING: The default login credentials are `evals@example.com` / `Password1`

To configure custom account credentials, simply override the rhsso role environment variables by specifying user parameters as part of the install command:

[source,shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/rhsso.yml -e rhsso_evals_username=<username> -e rhsso_evals_password=<password>
----

=== Run EnMasse install playbook

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/enmasse.yml
----

Once the playbook has completed a service named `EnMasse (standard)` will be available
in the Service Catalog. This can be provisioned into your namespace to use EnMasse.

=== Run Che install playbook

Set the following variables:

.Che installer playbook variables
|===
| Variable | Description
| che_route_suffix | The router suffix of the OpenShift cluster
| che_keycloak_host | The route to the previously created SSO, without protocol
| che_keycloak_user | Username to authenticate as, this would be the admin user by defaul
| che_keycloak_password | Password of the user
| che_namespace | The namesapce to provision che into
| che_infra_namespace | This can usually be the same as `che_namespace`
|===


[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/che-install.yml
----

=== Run Launcher install playbook

The Launcher playbook also requires information about the existing SSO that was
provisioned previously. It needs to know the route of the SSO. This can be
retrieved using:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get route sso -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n rhsso
----

It also needs to know the realm to interact with. By default this would be
`openshift`. Finally it needs the credentials of a user to login as, by default
this would be the `admin` user created by the SSO playbook.

Specify the following variables in the inventory files or as `--extra-vars` when
running the playbook.

.Launcher installer playbook variables
|===
| Variable | Description
| launcher_openshift_sso_route | The route to the previously created SSO, without protocol
| launcher_openshift_sso_realm | The realm to create resources in the SSO, this would be `openshift` by default
| launcher_openshift_sso_username | Username to authenticate as, this would be the admin user by default
| launcher_openshift_sso_password | Password of the user
|===


If using self signed certs set `launcher_sso_validate_certs` to `no/false`.
Without this, an error will be thrown similar to this:

----
fatal: [127.0.0.1]: FAILED! => {"msg": "The conditional check 'launcher_sso_auth_response.status == 200' failed. The error was: error while evaluating conditional (launcher_sso_auth_response.status == 200): 'dict object' has no attribute 'status'"}
----

Next, run the playbook.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/launcher.yml
----

Once the playbook has completed it will print a debug message saying to update
the `Authorization callback URL` of the GitHub OAuth Application. Once this is
done the launcher setup has finished.

=== Run 3Scale install playbook

WARNING: 3Scale requires access to ReadWriteMany PVs. As such, it will only work on Openshift clusters that have RWX PVs available.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/3scale.yml -e threescale_route_suffix=<openshift-router-suffix> -e enable_wildcard_route=<true/false>
----

=== Run Webapp install playbook

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login https://<openshift-master-url>
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/webapp.yml
----

== Check the installation

IMPORTANT: Once the installation has finished you will no longer be able to login via the Openshift console or oc cli as the admin if there is an sso redirect in place. The new admin user is `admin@example.com` password is `Password1`

The URL for the Integraly view is `https://tutorial-web-app-webapp.apps.<domain>/` 
For example, if the master url is `https://master.example.openshiftworkshop.com/`, the web app is available at  `https://tutorial-web-app-webapp.apps.example.openshiftworkshop.com/`.

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7708031/48856455-528f1000-edae-11e8-8c1a-f0b37a1049ce.png[integr8ly WebApp]

TIP: The project https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app[Webapp] is responsible for the Integraly interface. You can find the URL looking for the router created for this project. As the following example.

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7708031/48856461-5884f100-edae-11e8-92ca-ef4c93f8961f.png[integr8ly WebApp Router]

Also, with the *evals* users created by the installer is possible to check the services in the OpenShift catalog.

IMPORTANT: The default login credentials are `evals@example.com` / `Password1`

Following an image of this console as example.

:numbered!:
== Uninstalling Integreatly

Run the uninstall.yml playbook from the root of the repository:
[source,shell]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/uninstall.yml
----

By default this will delete all user-created namespaces as well, if you wish to keep these namespaces then add the following flag:
----
-e keep_namespaces=true
----

== Troubleshooting

.Message "You need to install \"jmespath\" prior to running json_query filter" is shown when the installation fails

The issue means that python version used by Ansible has not this required module. In order to fix it is required to install the missing module. Following the command to install it via `pip`.

[source,shell]
----
$ pip install jmespath
----

NOTE: The module need to be installed in the same version of python used by Ansible. Use the command `$ ansible --version` to check this path.

.Message "jsonpointer module is not available" is shown when the installation fails

The issue means that python version used by Ansible has not this required module.  In order to fix it is required to install the missing module. Following the command to install it via `pip`.

[source,shell]
----
$ pip install jsonpointer
----

Also, you might need to use the varible `ansible_python_interpreter` in the host file to fix it, for example:

[source,yum]
----
[local:vars]
ansible_connection=local
ansible_python_interpreter=python
----

TIP: The module need to be installed in the same version of python used by Ansible. Use the command `$ ansible --version` to check this path.

=== Self Signed Certs with Che
If your cluster is using a self signed (non CA) certificate, there are a couple of things that needs to be noted.

- Che will only allow the creation of one workspace when self signed certificates are used.
- When a workspace is created, the following errors may appear on the workspace:

----
Connection failed with terminal
Some error happened with terminal WebSocket connection
----

----
Failed to import project
----

- In order to solve these issues, you will need to accept the certs for all the routes that was created for that workspace. These routes are listed in the workspace deployment within the Che namespace.
